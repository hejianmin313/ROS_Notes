# Semiconductor Basics

Before semiconductor devices even existed, vacuum tubes were the only devices available for signal amplification, switching and other applications.  Though vacuum tubes are functional, they are bulky, require a high operating voltage and are completely inefficient. 

When semiconductors like transistors were invented, semiconductors started to acquire a dominating role in electronics. 

Semiconductors are materials that are in between conductors and insulators when it comes to the ability to conduct electrical current. Semiconductor materials have two current carriers, free electrons and holes.

Pentavalent atoms = atoms with five valence electrons

add them to the intrinsic material which generates a extra electron
