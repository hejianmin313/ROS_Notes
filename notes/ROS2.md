# ROS2 Note

## Concepts

* **Workspace**: directories where you store your packages; They help you organize your development environment and manage dependencies between packages

* **Packages**: Packages are basic units of ROS2; They contain executable files, libraries, scripts and other files needed for your ROS2 nodes

* **Launch Files**: Launch Files are XML files used to launch ROS2 nodes and set their parameters; They provide convenient ways to start multiple nodes with the correct configuration for your robot

* **Node**:executable files that perform computation in ROS2; They communicate with each other using topic, services and actions
